This repository contains the implemetation of SCE-Net from ICCV 2019 paper Learning Similarity Conditions Without Explicit Supervision

For the course project CSCI-5980, we used the this code as baseline and modified it to try other feature extraction models (ResNet-34, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, ResNext-50, ResNext-101). We used the pre-trained ResNet and ResNext models
from Pytorch which can be found in Resnet_models.py.
